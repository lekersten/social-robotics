##

We have implemented an interaction with the social robot which utilizes non-verbal interactions. The robot utilizes non-verbal gestures (greeting/beckoning waves, upset robot, 'huge', and bouncing/throwing basketball gesture). It also uses two non-verbal signals (card for yes or no and head tap to cheer up upset robot).

### Submitted Files

There is 1 files in the submission:
- **assignment2.py** - two paths: listen to story or upset robot

### Install Requirements
The requirements to run the code are in the ```requirements.txt``` file. 

### Running Code 
```
python3 assignment2.py
```
**Make sure to change the realm before running the code!**

### Disclaimer:
- Sometimes when you show a card, the robot may still remember the card the next time you run the code so you may have to rerun the code in order to have the robot register the card you want to show. 
- Sometimes the robot does not complete the full gestures so you may have to run the code again in order to see the gestures in full.
