##

We have implemented a verbal interaction through the use of a pre-trained LLM and a social robot in which the goal is to create a human-like companion.

### Submitted Files

There are 3 files in the submission:
- **assignment1.py**: latest tested version - robot hears itself speak and thus converses with itself
- **assignment1_untested.py**: untested version - hopefully fixes issue mentioned above
- **assignment1_godel.py**: user interaction through the terminal to test implemented LLM

### Install Requirements
```
conda create social-robotics
conda activate social-robotics
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Code
